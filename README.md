- Net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period
- Average of the Changes in Profit/Losses (tracks the total change in Profit/Losses from month to month)
- Greatest Increase in Profit/Losses (displaying date and amount) over the entire period
- Greatest Decrease in Profit/Losses (displaying date and amount) voer the entire period

console.log has been added throughout the script to ensure that there are no errors within the code. 
[This can be removed if necessary]
